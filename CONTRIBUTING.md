I need help styling and making it look cool.

If you think the code is horrendous, please help me make it nicer and more efficient. Especially the waiting part when the columns are loading irks me, could be done better.

Create a fork and make a PR with me as the assignee and i will get on it ASAP.

Thank you!

## Areas to improve

* Redirecting seems a bit wasteful. Is there a better solution? <https://github.com/mifriis/github-project-filter/blob/main/github-project-filter.user.js#L48>
* Timeouts are never cool and always the last resort, can you come up with something better? <https://github.com/mifriis/github-project-filter/blob/main/github-project-filter.user.js#L52>
